#### Project Examples

•	Equity Trading: While working for a large equity-trading company, you’re tasked with researching a client’s portfolio. Your client wants to invest in telecom stocks and needs expert analysis to make the right decision. Using the Nasdaq Data APILinks to an external site., pull a year’s worth of trading data for the major cell phone providers: AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Which stocks are trending upward? Which are trending downward? Based on the data, what would you recommend to your client?
•	New-Car Loan Analysis: People have been financing higher car values over longer amounts of time. Explore what is driving this trend. Search for answers by using data collected from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)Links to an external site.. What other questions can you answer with the data? What do your results suggest about the time value of money? What about the impact of these loans as time goes on?
